# Compass 

This package contains functions for hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation. More specifically, it can generate random candidates, score them (with the option of doing model repeats), and attain the top number of candidates. 

This package also contains functions for making average ensembles from a set of model repeats. It can also produce bootstrap ensembles for statistical assessment. 

Compass functions are used in two case studies: [synthetic data](https://github.com/Husam94/SynthSkew) and [YY1-DNA interactions](https://github.com/Husam94/YY1).
